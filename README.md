# Game of Life

The purpose of this project is to recreate a Cellular Automaton, John Conway's Game of Life.

## Functionning

John Conway's Game of Life work with three rules :

  1. Every cell have only 2 possible states :
     - Alive
     - Death
    
  2. If a dead cell is near 3 live cell, the cell become alive.
  
  3. To live, a cell must have 2 or 3 living neighbors.
  
 ## Functionalities
 
 ### Simulating Cells
 
 First of all, the principal functionality of this project is to simulate the 3 rules of Game of Life through a function.
 
 ### Add and remove cells in the window
 
The game starts with an empty grid in order to allow you to launch a simulation with any initial situation you wish.

Before simulating, using your mouse, you can left-click on any box of the grid to add or remove a living cell depending on what bouton you have clicked.

After you had created the initial situation you wish, you can start the simulation and observed what happen.

If you want to add or remove a living cell, stop the simulation.
